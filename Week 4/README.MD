# Week 4: GitHub and Source control

This week Michael Levan gives an overview on Git, Github and why it is used.

## Projects

The training is capped off by undergoing three projects:

- `Git and VS Code`
- `Git Merge Conflicts`
- `Cotributing to Open Source projects`

## Why source control?

- No longer storing code locally.
- Track and manage changes to code.
- Source of truth: Source Controls enables you to understand how a code is suppose to exist and wat the code is suppose to be.

## Some good coding ethics

- If possible, have someone review your code, not because you did the wrong thing but because we are humans and things could just slip by us. They could even have an idea to make your code better or faster or reusable or shorter - its a win win!
- Not all code needs to be commited to the repository right away

## Difference between Source Control and Version Control

So, Source control stores code for you, while version control manages a record of the code in versions.

Version Control manages a version of the code, it allows for comparions and differences in the code

## Source Control best practices

- Do not commit passwords/secrets
- Write good commit messages
- Ensure that you follow branching best practises
- Ensure that you commit your code often
